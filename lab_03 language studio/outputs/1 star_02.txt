We were looking forward to staying here but I must say it failed to live up to the expectations.

The service was not as good or as friendly as what we experienced at the OOO hotels.

The corridor outside our room was home to many pigeons who soiled the floor and the furniture, none of which was cleaned whilst we were there.

The indoor pool also had pigeons flying around and a tatty blue carpet surrounded the pool again with pigeon droppings.

When we left we were not offered any help with our cases, lugging them down the steps, luckily we’re young enough to manage but disappointing all the same.

After staying at two OOO hotels I fail to see how this hotel has been awarded so many accolades.
