Stayed 2 nights as part of a tour. Large compound provides great areas for roaming around.

Pool, despite being indoors, isn’t heated and actually colder than the outdoor pool. Jacuzzi wasn’t hot enough.

The international restaurant has a wide selection and the veranda cafe shared the same menu. Food overall is average. The train car restaurant Steam was great with casual appetizers, pizzas etc was much better.

As expected service was impeccable throughout the hotel. Bathroom commode had strands of hair so quite disappointing.
