Incredible luxury hotel in amazing grounds. Massive room and terrace and very friendly staff. Should have been perfect except for two things, Firstly the hot water in the sink and bath,
but not the shower, ran a dark brown colour on my second and third days, which stained the white flannel brown - it couldn't be rinsed out so it was probably dust/dirt. God forbid I had tried to wash a white item of clothing in the sink. Secondly, in spite of loads of staff eveywhere, it took 50 minutes to receive a morning coffee via room service and even then I had to phone and re-order. So while the hotel is spectacular, it has serious defects.
