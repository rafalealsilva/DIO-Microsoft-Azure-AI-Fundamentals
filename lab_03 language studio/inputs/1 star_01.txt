I am a loyal TTT patron, and Epicure member. Today my trust and affection for TTT was severely diminished, as I was turned away from the main gates of the RRR Palace in Jaipur, where I had dropped by for dinner.

Reeks of insane classism and elitist attitude, that goes against the very founding story of the TTT hotels, a hotel, that was meant for every Indian.
