We booked this restaurant for the novelty of eating in a converted train, which we loved. But we were equally impressed with the food and service. In particular we were very happy with Yogendra, our server, and Robin, the bartender. Our favorite dish was the spinach and feta pide, but everything we had was top notch. We loved all of the drinks we had, as well.
