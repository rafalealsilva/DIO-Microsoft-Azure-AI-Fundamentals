It was a hell experience, The staff is not at all supportive and helpful starting from the front office till service and other staff too.

It was like on reception we met Anushka she was busy 8. Her own not attending and answering us .

We were looking for a restaurant where a person Name MMM was passing by we just asked him him a way towards restaurant and asked him some thing he give the ridiculous replay that he from HHH Associate you can take help from reception , when we came to reception we came to know that he is doing his training. What the hell people even don't know what position they are working in .

The restaurant service was also not up to mark .

Terrible service , Terrible staff .
